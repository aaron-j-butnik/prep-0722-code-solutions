    <h1 style="color: green;">My favorite Star Wars character is Jyn Erso</h1>

    <p style="color: brown;">Jyn Erso is my favorite Star Wars character because she is unlike any other main character in Star Wars.  She is not a Jedi or a person with any high rank like a Rebel Officer or Senator.  However, she may be the single most important character because without her, the Death Star plans would have never made it to the Rebels, and Luke would never have been able to get off his famous shots destroying the Death Star.  (Also, I think Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie of them all!! ;) )</p>
